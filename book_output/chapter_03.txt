# Chapter 3: The Burden of Vision

*"To see the future is to be trapped by it. Prescience becomes a cage when the seer cannot distinguish between the path and the prison. The true power lies not in knowing what will come, but in choosing what to do with that knowledge."*
—From "Conversations with Muad'Dib," by the Princess Irulan

The air in the sietch corridor hung heavy with the scent of spice, an omnipresent aroma that clung to the rock walls like memory itself. Jeff followed Paul through the narrow passage, watching how the young Atreides moved with a newfound certainty that seemed to have crystallized in the weeks since their escape from the Harkonnen attack. No longer the ducal heir in exile; Paul had become something else entirely—something that made Jeff increasingly uneasy.

"You're troubled," Paul said without turning, his voice carrying the subtle harmonics of command that he had begun to employ unconsciously. "Your thoughts betray you."

Jeff adjusted the stillsuit at his neck, feeling the familiar discomfort of being read so easily. "I'm troubled by what I see happening to you," he replied, measuring his words with the precision of a Mentat. "The spice is changing you."

Paul stopped then, turning to face him in the dim light of the passage. His eyes, once a sharp blue, now burned with the total saturation of melange—the deep indigo-within-indigo that marked him as something more than human.

"Not changing," Paul corrected. "Awakening. There's a difference."

"Is there?" Jeff challenged, feeling the weight of their friendship—a relationship formed before this transformation had begun. "The Fremen already whisper 'Muad'Dib' and 'Lisan al-Gaib' when you pass. I've seen how Stilgar defers to you. How Chani watches you."

A shadow of something—perhaps regret, perhaps amusement—passed across Paul's face. "You fear I'm becoming what the Bene Gesserit planned."

"I fear you're becoming what no one planned," Jeff said. "Even the Reverend Mothers couldn't have foreseen this."

Paul's gaze seemed to look through him, beyond the moment, into those terrible futures he had begun to glimpse. "No," he agreed after a moment. "They couldn't."

The silence between them expanded, becoming a thing with substance and weight. It was the silence of paths diverging.

"Come," Paul said at last. "Stilgar awaits us in the Council chamber. We have much to discuss before tomorrow's raid."

---

The Council chamber of Sietch Tabr hummed with tension. Fremen leaders sat in a rough semicircle, their stillsuits creaking slightly with each movement. At the center stood Stilgar, his weathered face impassive beneath his hood, but his eyes watchful, calculating.

Jeff positioned himself slightly behind Paul, observing the dynamics with the analytical detachment he had cultivated over years of training. The pattern was clear: power was shifting in subtle increments, moving inexorably toward Paul despite Stilgar's nominal leadership.

"The Harkonnen water-fat have doubled the garrison at the southern basin," Stilgar announced, gesturing to a rough map etched into the sand table. "They hunt our water-stealers with increasing desperation."

"They fear us now," said an older Fremen named Turok, his voice carrying the graveled quality of one who had inhaled too much dust outside a stillsuit. "They know the desert has teeth."

Murmurs of approval rippled through the assembly. Jeff noted how their eyes flickered toward Paul, seeking his reaction even as they addressed Stilgar.

"Fear makes them dangerous," Paul said, stepping forward. His voice was quiet, yet it cut through the murmurs like a crysknife through flesh. "They'll sacrifice anything to maintain control of the spice operations."

"Let them come to the desert," another Fremen growled. "We'll feed them to Shai-Hulud."

Jeff observed how Paul's eyes narrowed slightly—the only outward sign of the calculations surely racing through his mind. He had seen this look before, the moment when Paul's awareness expanded beyond normal human perception, when prescience began to work its terrible magic.

"No," Paul said after a moment. "That's what they expect. They've adjusted their tactics based on our previous raids. They're attempting to draw us into an ambush."

Stilgar's gaze sharpened. "You've seen this, Muad'Dib?"

The use of the name—the secret name given to Paul by the Fremen—carried weight. Jeff watched as Paul hesitated, weighing the implications of confirming his visions to the council.

"I've analyzed their patterns," Paul replied, the careful evasion a reminder that he had not yet fully embraced the mantle being offered to him. "They're consolidating their forces around the water basins while leaving the spice operations with minimal protection. It's a trap."

"Then what do you propose?" Stilgar asked, the question itself a subtle yielding of authority.

Paul moved to the sand table, his movements fluid and precise. With quick gestures, he began to trace new patterns in the sand, restructuring the planned attack.

"We divide our forces," he explained. "A small group creates a diversion at the water basin—enough to convince them their trap has worked. Meanwhile, our main force strikes here—" His finger jabbed into the sand, marking a location far from the expected target. "—at the new spice harvesting operation they believe we don't know about."

Jeff watched the faces of the Fremen elders as they absorbed Paul's strategy. He saw the moment when suspicion gave way to calculation, and calculation to acceptance. They were being drawn into Paul's orbit, becoming instruments of a design they couldn't fully comprehend.

"It's a good plan," Stilgar conceded, his voice carrying the gruff approval of a leader who recognized superior strategy. "But risky for the diversion force."

"I'll lead the diversion myself," Paul said.

The pronouncement sent a ripple of surprise through the council. Jeff stepped forward without thinking.

"That's unacceptable," he stated flatly, feeling the eyes of the Fremen shift to him. "You're too valuable to risk on a diversion."

Paul turned to him, and for an instant, Jeff glimpsed something in his friend's eyes—a flicker of the future, perhaps, or a knowing that transcended the moment.

"I must be seen," Paul said quietly. "The Harkonnen must believe they've located me. Otherwise, the deception fails."

"Then I'll accompany you," Jeff insisted, aware that he was challenging Paul before the council but unable to restrain himself.

A ghost of a smile touched Paul's lips. "I was counting on it."

Stilgar's weathered hand came down on the sand table with finality. "It is decided, then. Muad'Dib leads the diversion. Stilgar leads the main attack. We move at second moonrise tomorrow."

The council dispersed, Fremen warriors moving with the silent efficiency that had made them the desert's deadliest inhabitants. Jeff remained, watching as Paul continued to study the sand table, his fingers tracing patterns only he could see.

"You manipulated them," Jeff observed when they were alone. "You knew exactly what they would decide before you entered the chamber."

Paul looked up, his spice-blue eyes unreadable. "I saw possibilities."

"And chose the one that puts you in the greatest danger."

"I chose the one with the best chance of success."

Jeff moved closer, lowering his voice despite their solitude. "There's something you're not telling me about this raid. Something you've seen."

The silence stretched between them, taut with unspoken truths. Finally, Paul straightened, brushing sand from his fingers with deliberate care.

"There are some things," he said, "that must be experienced, not foretold. Even for those of us cursed with the sight."

---

The stillness of the deep desert night enveloped them as they crouched behind a ridge of weathered rock. The Harkonnen water station glowed in the distance, its lights creating an artificial oasis in the darkness. Beside Jeff, Paul lay motionless, only his eyes moving as he scanned the facility below.

Six other Fremen warriors were distributed along the ridge, their stillsuits making them nearly invisible against the rock. The double moons of Arrakis hung low in the sky, casting conflicting shadows across the dunes.

"Four perimeter guards," Paul whispered, his voice barely audible even in the silence. "Two patrol vehicles. Approximately twenty soldiers within the compound."

Jeff adjusted the maula pistol at his hip. "And at least one ornithopter on standby," he added, indicating the landing pad visible on the facility's eastern edge. "Exactly as you predicted."

Paul's gaze shifted briefly to him, acknowledging the observation without comment. They both knew what remained unsaid: that Paul's "predictions" were becoming increasingly precise, increasingly unsettling in their accuracy.

"We have eighteen minutes before Stilgar's force reaches the spice operation," Paul continued. "We need to ensure all attention is focused here when they strike."

One of the Fremen—a lean, hard-faced man named Farok—slid closer. "The charges are set, Muad'Dib," he reported. "We await your command."

Jeff observed how naturally the Fremen deferred to Paul now, how the title of "Muad'Dib" had replaced his name in their speech. It was a transformation happening by increments, and he wondered if Paul himself fully understood the implications.

"On my signal," Paul replied, his eyes distant for a moment—that familiar look of seeing beyond the present. Then he focused again, nodding to Farok. "Remember: we need to draw them out, not destroy them completely. Our goal is distraction, not annihilation."

"As you say, Muad'Dib," Farok acknowledged, though Jeff detected the faint note of disappointment in the Fremen's voice. These desert warriors had generations of hatred for the Harkonnen; the concept of measured violence was foreign to their thinking.

Paul checked the timepiece strapped to his wrist—a subtle gesture that reminded Jeff of the Duke Leto, Paul's father. For an instant, the resemblance was striking, and Jeff felt a pang of memory for the man who had been both his commander and mentor.

"Now," Paul said softly.

Farok raised a small signaling device and pressed its activation stud. For three heartbeats, nothing happened. Then the night erupted in a sequence of precisely timed explosions along the western perimeter of the Harkonnen facility. Flame bloomed against the darkness, followed by the muffled sound of detonations carrying across the sand.

Immediately, the compound burst into frantic activity. Alarms wailed as guards rushed toward the breached perimeter, weapons drawn. The patrol vehicles roared to life, their engines growling as they sped toward the explosions.

"Second phase," Paul commanded, and two more Fremen activated their detonators.

New explosions blossomed on the opposite side of the compound. Jeff watched the confusion spread among the Harkonnen forces as they struggled to determine which threat was primary.

"They'll figure it out soon," he warned, already seeing how the commander was organizing his forces into defensive positions rather than pursuing phantoms into the dark.

Paul nodded. "That's why we become the third phase ourselves."

He rose into a half-crouch and gestured to the Fremen. With silent efficiency, they began to move along the ridge, spreading out to create the illusion of a larger force. Paul checked his crysknife and maula pistol, then gave Jeff a look that carried memories of a thousand shared moments—from the formal halls of Castle Caladan to the desperate flight across the desert of Arrakis.

"Try to keep up," Paul said, a fleeting smile touching his lips—a rare glimpse of the boy he had been before the weight of destiny had settled on his shoulders.

Then he was moving, descending the ridge with the practiced ease of one born to the desert. Jeff followed, feeling the familiar surge of adrenaline as they committed themselves to action.

They struck like wind-devils materializing from the darkness. Three Fremen launched themselves at the nearest guard post, their crysknives flashing in the moonlight. Paul and Jeff targeted the command center, moving with coordinated precision honed through countless training sessions.

The first Harkonnen soldier never saw them coming. Jeff's knife found the gap in the man's armor where neck met shoulder, a silent kill that dropped him without a sound. Paul moved past, already engaging the next opponent—a larger man with a lasgun who managed to fire a single shot before Paul's knife slipped between his ribs.

"The communications array," Paul directed, pointing to a cluster of equipment on the building's roof. "It needs to be disabled."

Jeff nodded, changing direction while Paul continued toward the main entrance. The desert training had hardened his muscles, made him capable of feats he wouldn't have attempted months ago. He scaled the side of the building using minimal handholds, pulling himself onto the roof with a grace that would have impressed even Duncan Idaho, the swordmaster who had trained them both.

The communications array was simple enough to disable—a matter of severing the right connections and removing key components. As he worked, Jeff kept one eye on the compound below, tracking Paul's progress. He watched as his friend—no, more than friend, the man who was becoming something beyond ordinary humanity—cut through the Harkonnen defenders with terrible efficiency.

There was something both magnificent and horrifying in Paul's combat style now. He moved with prescient awareness, seeming to anticipate attacks before they were launched, positioning himself where enemies would be rather than where they were. It was as if he fought not against the present but against a future only he could see.

The radio crackled to life at Jeff's belt—the signal from Stilgar's force that they had begun their attack on the spice operation. Right on schedule. Jeff finished disabling the communications array and prepared to descend.

That's when he saw the ornithopter rise from behind the compound—not the one they had observed on the landing pad, but a second craft, hidden until now. Its searchlight blazed to life, sweeping the compound and catching Paul in its harsh illumination.

Even from a distance, Jeff saw Paul freeze, his head tilting slightly in that characteristic gesture that indicated he was processing a vision. For a crucial moment, he remained motionless as the ornithopter banked toward him.

"Paul!" Jeff shouted, abandoning stealth as he scrambled down from the roof.

The ornithopter's weapons system engaged, sending a burst of projectiles toward Paul's position. At the last possible instant, Paul moved, rolling aside as the ground where he had stood erupted in sand and fire. But he wasn't entirely untouched—Jeff saw him stumble, one hand pressing against his side.

Fighting his way across the compound, Jeff reached Paul just as a second weapons burst from the ornithopter tore through the space between them. He pulled his friend behind the shelter of a storage building, noticing the dark stain spreading across Paul's stillsuit.

"You're hit," he stated, already reaching for the small medkit at his belt.

Paul shook his head, his breathing controlled despite the pain. "Superficial. The future... shifts. Something unexpected—"

The rest of his words were drowned out by the roar of the ornithopter as it made another pass. Above the engine noise, Jeff heard a voice amplified through a speaker system:

"Surrender Muad'Dib and the rest may live! We know he is among you!"

The pronouncement sent a chill through Jeff that had nothing to do with the desert night. They knew Paul's Fremen name—a detail that should have been unknown to the Harkonnen forces.

"There's a traitor," he said, meeting Paul's gaze.

Paul nodded, his eyes distant again. "Yes. I see it now. The pattern was there, but I missed it." He grimaced, pressing his hand more firmly against his wound. "We need to withdraw. The mission is accomplished—Stilgar's force will have taken the spice operation by now."

Jeff activated his communicator, signaling the Fremen to begin their retreat. Already they were melting away from the engagement, disappearing into the darkness with the skill born of generations in the desert.

"Can you move?" he asked Paul, eyeing the wound with concern.

"I can move," Paul confirmed, though his face was pale beneath its desert tan. "But we have a complication."

"Besides the ornithopter hunting us and a traitor in our midst?"

A ghost of a smile touched Paul's lips. "Besides that." He nodded toward the eastern horizon, where a faint trembling had begun to disturb the sand. "Our diversion worked too well."

Jeff felt it then—the rhythmic vibration in the ground that every desert dweller learned to recognize. "Worm sign," he whispered.

"A big one," Paul agreed. "Coming fast. Our explosions and the Harkonnen vehicles have attracted it."

The ornithopter swept overhead again, its searchlight stabbing into the darkness, seeking them. The Harkonnen voice boomed: "This is your final warning! Surrender Muad'Dib!"

Paul straightened, his decision made. "We need to get clear of the compacted ground. Once we're in the open desert, we can use the thumper to direct the worm between us and the Harkonnen forces."

Jeff nodded, though he knew the plan carried substantial risk—especially with Paul injured. But there were no safe options left. He supported Paul with one arm, and together they began to move toward the darkness beyond the compound's perimeter.

They had covered perhaps fifty meters when the ornithopter's searchlight found them. Immediately, the craft banked sharply, descending toward their position.

"Run!" Paul commanded, pushing Jeff away. "I'll draw them off!"

"Not happening," Jeff replied grimly, pulling Paul along faster. "We go together or not at all."

The sand beneath their feet was changing texture—becoming softer, less compacted. They were reaching the edge of the facility's perimeter. Just a little farther, and they could deploy the thumper...

The ornithopter was almost upon them, its weapons system locking onto their position. Jeff could see the pilot now, a harsh-faced woman with the insignia of a Harkonnen captain on her uniform. Beside her sat a larger figure whose features were obscured by shadow.

Paul stumbled, his injury finally overcoming his iron discipline. As Jeff caught him, the ornithopter opened fire, sand erupting around them in a deadly pattern. They were out of time and options.

Then the world itself seemed to rise against the Harkonnen craft. A massive wall of sand burst upward from the desert floor, towering over them as Shai-Hulud—a great maker of Arrakis—breached the surface in a display of primal power that made human weapons seem trivial by comparison.

The ornithopter pilot reacted too slowly, attempting to pull up and away from the monstrous apparition. One great section of worm-body collided with the craft, sending it spinning through the air. For an instant, it seemed the pilot might regain control—then the ornithopter plummeted into the churning sand where the worm had emerged.

"The worm that follows," Paul
