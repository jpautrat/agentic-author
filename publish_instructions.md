# Publishing Agentic Author to GitHub

Since I don't have direct access to push to your GitHub repository, here are the steps to publish the project:

## Option 1: Using the Command Line

1. Open a command prompt in the project directory

2. Initialize a Git repository (if not already done):
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files to Git:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Agentic Author with Web UI"
   ```

5. Add your GitHub repository as the remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jpautrat/agentic-author.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   Note: If your default branch is called "master" instead of "main", use:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop

2. Add the local repository (File > Add local repository...)

3. Navigate to your project folder and select it

4. Commit the changes with the message "Initial commit of Agentic Author with Web UI"

5. Publish the repository to GitHub, selecting your existing repository (jpautrat/agentic-author)

## Option 3: Manual Upload

If you're having trouble with Git, you can also:

1. Go to https://github.com/jpautrat/agentic-author in your browser

2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"

3. Drag and drop all the project files

4. Click "Commit changes"

Note: This method is not recommended for large projects as it doesn't handle Git properly.

## After Publishing

Once published, you can:

1. Run the web UI to generate screenshots:
   ```
   run_with_ui.bat
   ```

2. Take screenshots of the dashboard, generation page, and library

3. Save the screenshots to the `docs/screenshots/` directory

4. Commit and push these screenshots to make the README more visually appealing
