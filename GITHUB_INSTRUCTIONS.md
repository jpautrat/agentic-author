# GitHub Publishing Instructions

To publish your Agentic Author project to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Authentication Setup

First, you need to set up authentication for GitHub:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name like "Agentic Author"
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)

### Option 2: SSH Key

If you prefer using SSH:

1. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one
2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account
3. Update your repository remote to use SSH

## 2. Push Your Changes

### Using Personal Access Token

```bash
# Set the remote URL with your token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/jpautrat/agentic-author.git

# Push your changes
git push -u origin main
```

### Using SSH

```bash
# Set the remote URL to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jpautrat/agentic-author.git

# Push your changes
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository to verify everything looks good:

## What's Been Done

Your Agentic Author project is now fully prepared for GitHub with:

1. ✅ Properly named screenshots
2. ✅ Updated README with features and instructions
3. ✅ Cleaned up repository structure
4. ✅ Development files moved to a separate directory
5. ✅ Updated LICENSE with your screen name "jpautrat"

All that's left is to authenticate with GitHub and push your changes!

## Next Steps (Optional)

After publishing to GitHub, consider:

1. Adding more screenshots of the library page
